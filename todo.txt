TODO List for Text Adventure Game:
-make syntax for input more lenient; process input in Command class
-try making variables and methods in PlayerCharacter all static to access PlayerCharacter without having to pass a variable through methods
-add gold value to items and enable player to sell/buy items
-make 2D array grid of wilderness locations with tags on locations to tell if they have any other Exits to look at (like caves or houses or dungeons or any special location)
-make inventory size smaller and restrict putting things in inventory
-test core game with lots and lots of items and interactions and locations
-change Command.Inspect to work with Interactions (able to inspect a phenomenon for more information; or the inspection could trigger it, like inspecting a moving bush to get attacked by a bandit)
-bug: help command displays 2 sets of commands
-bug: add inventory to help command
